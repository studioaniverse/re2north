Return to the North: Virtual Archaeology of Electronic Orbits is a
6DoF XR interactive narrative work. The historical development
of railway networks profoundly reshaped the visual culture and
lived experience of cities in northern China. However, this infrastructure
paradoxically contributed to the gradual depletion of
resources across the region while simultaneously connecting towns.

The Railway orbits not only physically isolated communities but
also fragmented them within virtual algorithmic databases. With
the rise of large-scale AI models, cultural images are increasingly
filtered, often correlating positively with economic development
and capital flows. In this sense, digital infrastructure can be seen
as parasitizing the remnants of industrial infrastructure. This artwork
envisions an optimistic future archaeological landscape where
electronic orbits connect data islands, transforming them into distributed
virtual narrative spaces.
